    "### 🎯 Lab Objectives\n",
    "This lab demonstrates the integration of modern AI technologies for document processing:\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration and state management\n",
    "- **LangChain**: Document parsing and text processing\n",
    "- **OpenAI**: Vision-based extraction and embeddings\n",
    "- **Pinecone**: Vector storage and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Business Rules\n",
    "**Invoice Validation Logic:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Valid**: All required fields present (vendor name, invoice number, date, amount)\n",
    "- ❌ **Invalid**: Missing any required field\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Expected Outcomes\n",
    "1. Convert PDFs to markdown and display content\n",
    "2. Validate invoices based on business rules\n",
    "3. Store markdown content in vector database\n",
    "4. Execute test queries with structured results"

As for the main content of your letter, there are often three main parts: the introduction, paragraph, and conclusion.\n",
